# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
/tmp/storage/*
!/tmp/storage/
!/tmp/storage/.keep

/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
 
 # .gitignore
 node_modules/

 In this PR I :

- Created a new app. Give it a meaningful name.
- Initialized the project with Git.
- Make sure that the project has Postgres database set up.
- Built the project schema.
    - Created and ran the necessary migration files.
    - Table and column names should match the ERD diagram.
        - note: photo for users table should be a link to an image
    - Foreign keys should be included.
    - All columns that are foreign keys have a corresponding index.
